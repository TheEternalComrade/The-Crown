# The-Crown
My PCB for the Solder YSWS! My name means "the crown becomes joy", so I like to incorporate
regalia into my projects. Thus, this pcb is in the shape of a crown. The 2 leds light up in the dark,
and a vibration motor is controlled my a potentiometer. There are two holes to attach a lanyard to.
My favorite part of this pcb is the art littered about it.
